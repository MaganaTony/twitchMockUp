# React JS with Tailwind for Twitch mockup

This project's purpose is to create website using Vite/ReactJs and Vite

## Here are the technologies the project used:

The project uses Javascript on it's entirety and Node to install packages such as modules


| Technology | Description |
|------------|-------------|
|React.JS| "React.js is a popular JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data changes over time. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, which manage their own state and update efficiently when data changes. React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering, making it fast and responsive. It's widely used for its flexibility, component-based architecture, and ease of integration with other libraries and frameworks." |
|Node.JS| "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side, enabling the creation of fast, scalable, and efficient web applications"|
|Tailwind| "Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of predefined classes to build custom designs quickly. Instead of writing custom CSS, developers use Tailwind's utility classes directly in their HTML to style elements, allowing for rapid and consistent UI development. It offers flexibility and responsiveness, making it easy to create complex layouts without leaving the HTML file. Tailwind is highly customizable, allowing developers to extend or override the default styles to fit the needs of their projects."|
|Vite JS| "Vite is a fast and modern build tool and development server for front-end projects. Developed by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, Vite offers an efficient development experience with near-instant startup times, leveraging native ES modules for modern browsers. It features hot module replacement (HMR) for quick updates during development and is framework-agnostic, supporting Vue, React, Svelte, and other front-end frameworks. Vite optimizes the final build by bundling assets with tools like Rollup, making it a popular choice for modern web development."

## How do we install it?

First we need to clone the repository on your machine with Git
